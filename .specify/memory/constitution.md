# Photo Manager Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Privacy-First Architecture
Photos and personal data MUST never leave the local device. All processing, storage, and management operations are performed locally. Cloud features are limited to metadata synchronization with explicit user consent and end-to-end encryption. No telemetry or analytics that could compromise user privacy.

**Rationale**: Photography is deeply personal, and users must have complete control over their private memories and data.

### II. Performance Optimization
The application MUST provide fast loading and responsive interaction even with large photo collections (100,000+ photos). Image loading must be optimized through progressive loading, efficient caching, and background processing. Database operations must be indexed and optimized for photo metadata queries.

**Rationale**: Poor performance destroys the user experience when managing large photo collections and makes the application unusable at scale.

### III. Universal Accessibility
The application MUST support comprehensive keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and high contrast modes. All UI elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Navigation patterns must be consistent and predictable across all features.

**Rationale**: Photo management should be accessible to all users regardless of their abilities or assistive technology needs.

### IV. Code Quality Excellence
All code MUST be thoroughly tested with comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Architecture must follow clean code principles with clear separation of concerns, dependency injection, and modular design. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes.

**Rationale**: Photo management involves irreplaceable personal data; bugs or architectural issues could result in permanent data loss.

### V. Responsive User Experience
The UI MUST respond to user interactions within 100ms for immediate feedback and complete operations within 2 seconds for normal workflow actions. Long-running operations must provide clear progress indicators and remain cancellable.

**Rationale**: Photo management involves frequent browsing and organization; any UI lag significantly impacts the user workflow and productivity.

## Data Storage & Management Guidelines

**Local Storage Architecture**: Photos are stored in user-controlled file systems with metadata in local SQLite databases. File organization follows user-defined directory structures with optional automatic organization based on EXIF data.

**Backup Strategies**: Users control all backup operations. The application provides tools for creating local backups and optionally encrypted cloud backups, but never automatically uploads content without explicit user consent.

**Performance Standards**: Database queries must complete within 50ms for metadata operations. Image thumbnails must load within 200ms. Full-resolution images must begin loading within 500ms with progressive enhancement.

## Development Standards & Quality Assurance

**Testing Requirements**: Minimum 90% code coverage with unit tests. All user workflows must have corresponding integration tests. Performance regression tests are required for critical paths.

**Architecture Standards**: Clean architecture with domain-driven design principles. Repository pattern for data access. Command/Query separation for operations. Dependency injection for testability.

**Code Review Process**: All code changes require peer review focusing on: functionality correctness, performance impact, accessibility compliance, security implications, and architectural consistency.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and technical decisions. Any deviation from these principles must be documented with explicit justification and approved through the amendment process.

All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity that violates constitutional principles must be simplified or removed unless absolutely necessary and properly justified.

**Amendment Process**: Constitutional changes require documentation of the proposed change, impact analysis on existing systems, and consensus from all active contributors. Changes affecting core principles (Privacy, Performance, Accessibility) require additional justification and migration planning.

**Compliance Review**: Monthly reviews of architecture decisions, performance metrics, and accessibility compliance. Quarterly security audits of privacy protection measures.
