# Implementation Plan: PhotoManager - Personal Photo Collection Organizer

**Branch**: `001-build-photomanager-a` | **Date**: 2025-09-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-photomanager-a/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
PhotoManager is a web application for organizing personal photo collections with automatic date-based album creation and custom album support. Key features include drag-and-drop reorganization, photo tagging/captioning, responsive design, and efficient handling of thousands of photos.

**Structure Decision**: Single web application architecture chosen as PhotoManager is a frontend-only application with no backend server requirements. The structure follows modular design principles with clear separation between data models, business services, UI components, and utilities.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Infrastructure tasks: Project setup, build configuration, testing framework
- Model tasks: TypeScript interfaces and validation from data model
- Service contract tasks: Interface implementations for PhotoService, AlbumService, StorageService
- Storage layer tasks: IndexedDB setup, Dexie integration, database schema
- Core service tasks: Business logic implementation with error handling
- Component tasks: Reusable UI components for albums, photos, drag-drop, search
- Page tasks: Main application views (HomePage, AlbumView, PhotoView)
- Integration tasks: Service integration, file handling, EXIF processing
- Feature tasks: Complete user workflows (import, organize, search, tag)
- Testing tasks: Unit tests for services, integration tests for workflows, E2E tests
- Polish tasks: Performance optimization, accessibility, responsive design

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Phase A: Project Infrastructure & Models [P]
  - Vite setup with TypeScript
  - Testing framework configuration
  - TypeScript model definitions
  - Development tooling setup
- Phase B: Storage & Core Services [P]
  - IndexedDB schema setup
  - StorageService implementation
  - Basic service interfaces
- Phase C: Business Logic Implementation
  - PhotoService with file handling and EXIF
  - AlbumService with organization logic
  - Service integration and error handling
- Phase D: UI Foundation [P]
  - Basic component library
  - Styling system setup
  - Layout components
- Phase E: Core Features
  - Photo import workflow
  - Album display and management
  - Drag-and-drop functionality
- Phase F: Advanced Features
  - Search and filtering
  - Tagging system
  - Performance optimization
- Phase G: Testing & Polish
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Accessibility compliance
  - Responsive design refinement

**Dependencies**:
- Models → Services → Components → Pages
- Storage setup → Service implementation
- Basic UI → Advanced interactions
- Core features → Performance optimization

**Parallel Execution Markers**:
- [P] for independent model definitions
- [P] for component development within same layer
- [P] for test file creation alongside implementation

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, dependency-ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Testing Integration**:
- Each service contract → interface compliance test
- Each user story from spec → integration test scenario
- Each component → unit test with mocked dependencies
- Complete workflows → end-to-end test coverage

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- Privacy: All tasks maintain local-only data handling
- Performance: Tasks include optimization and monitoring
- Accessibility: UI tasks include WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Quality: TDD approach with comprehensive testing
- UX: Response time targets built into implementation tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
