# Research & Technical Decisions

## Overview
Research findings for PhotoManager implementation covering technology choices, browser APIs, performance optimization strategies, and architectural patterns.

## Technical Stack Decisions

### 1. Build System & Framework
**Decision**: Vite with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Fast development server with HMR
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Small production bundles
- Native ES modules support
- Simple configuration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Webpack: More complex configuration, slower dev server
- Parcel: Less control over build process
- Rollup: More manual setup required

### 2. Local Storage Strategy
**Decision**: IndexedDB with Dexie.js wrapper
**Rationale**:
- Can handle large amounts of structured data
- Asynchronous API doesn't block UI
- Better performance than localStorage for complex queries
- Transactions and indexing support

**Alternatives considered**:
- localStorage: 5-10MB limit, synchronous API
- WebSQL: Deprecated technology
- File System Access API: For file operations only, not metadata storage

### 3. File Access Method
**Decision**: File System Access API with drag-and-drop fallback
**Rationale**:
- Direct file system access in supported browsers
- Better user experience for large collections
- Maintains file references without copying
- Graceful degradation to drag-and-drop

**Alternatives considered**:
- File input only: Poor UX for large collections
- Drag-and-drop only: Requires copying files to memory

### 4. Image Processing & EXIF
**Decision**: ExifReader library for EXIF parsing
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and focused on EXIF data
- Good browser compatibility
- TypeScript definitions available
- No dependencies

**Alternatives considered**:
- piexifjs: Larger bundle size
- exif-js: Less maintained
- Native implementation: Too complex for MVP

### 5. Drag & Drop Implementation
**Decision**: SortableJS for drag-and-drop functionality
**Rationale**:
- Mature library with extensive features
- Touch device support
- Animation and visual feedback
- Good performance with large lists

**Alternatives considered**:
- react-beautiful-dnd: React-specific
- HTML5 native: Complex implementation for advanced features
- Custom implementation: High development cost

## Browser Compatibility Strategy

### File System Access API Support
- Chrome 86+: Full support
- Firefox: Behind flag, use drag-and-drop fallback
- Safari 14+: Partial support
- Edge 86+: Full support

### IndexedDB Support
- Universal support across modern browsers
- Graceful error handling for storage quota exceeded

### CSS Grid & Flexbox
- Excellent support across target browsers
- Fallbacks not needed for target browser versions

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Image Loading & Thumbnails
**Strategy**: Progressive loading with intersection observer
- Generate thumbnails using Canvas API
- Lazy load full-resolution images
- Cache thumbnails in IndexedDB
- Use WebP format where supported

### 2. Virtual Scrolling
**Strategy**: Implement virtual scrolling for large photo collections
- Only render visible items
- Recycle DOM elements
- Maintain scroll position during updates

### 3. Background Processing
**Strategy**: Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks
- EXIF data extraction
- Thumbnail generation
- Search indexing
- File system scanning

### 4. Memory Management
**Strategy**: Aggressive cleanup and garbage collection
- Release image references when not visible
- Limit concurrent image loading
- Use object pools for frequently created objects

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Data Layer Architecture
**Pattern**: Repository pattern with service layer
- Models define data structure
- Services handle business logic
- Repository abstraction for storage operations
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. State Management
**Pattern**: Event-driven architecture with custom event system
- Minimal external dependencies
- Component communication via events
- Centralized state for global data
- Local state for component-specific data

### 3. Component Architecture
**Pattern**: Composition over inheritance
- Small, focused components
- Reusable UI primitives
- Props-based configuration
- Event callback patterns

## Security Considerations

### 1. File Access Security
- Validate file types before processing
- Sanitize file names and paths
- Limit file size to prevent memory issues
- Handle permission errors gracefully

### 2. Storage Security
- No sensitive data stored
- Local-only storage prevents data leaks
- Clear data on application reset

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing
- Vitest for fast unit tests
- Mock file system operations
- Test data transformations and utilities

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Validate data flow between services
- Mock browser APIs

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- Playwright for browser automation
- Test complete user workflows
- Performance regression testing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Basic file import and display
- IndexedDB setup and models
- Basic album creation

### Phase 2: User Interface
- Grid layouts and responsive design
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Search and filtering

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility improvements
- Error handling and edge cases

## Dependencies Summary

**Required External Libraries**:
- ExifReader (~15KB): EXIF metadata parsing
- SortableJS (~30KB): Drag-and-drop functionality
- Dexie.js (~50KB): IndexedDB wrapper

**Total Bundle Impact**: ~95KB additional dependencies
**Justification**: Each library provides significant functionality that would be costly to implement from scratch while maintaining the small bundle size requirement.
