# Feature Specification: PhotoManager - Personal Photo Collection Organizer

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-photomanager-a`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build PhotoManager, a web application for organizing personal photo collections. Users can create photo albums that are automatically grouped by date (year/month). The main interface shows a grid of album thumbnails that can be reorganized through drag-and-drop. Each album displays a tile-based preview of photos within it. Photos are never uploaded to any server - everything stays local. The app should handle thousands of photos efficiently. Users can create custom albums beyond the automatic date grouping. Within albums, photos can be rearranged, and users can add captions or tags. The interface should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: photo organization, album management, date grouping, drag-and-drop, local storage, tagging
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to organize their personal photo collection stored on their device. They open PhotoManager and see their photos automatically organized into date-based albums (by year/month). They can view these albums as thumbnail grids, create custom albums for special events, and reorganize everything through drag-and-drop. Within each album, they can rearrange photos, add captions, and tag photos for easy searching. The entire experience works seamlessly on both their desktop computer and mobile phone, with all data staying completely local to their device.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has photos on their device, **When** they first open PhotoManager, **Then** the system automatically creates date-based albums (year/month) and displays them as thumbnail grids on the main interface
2. **Given** the main album grid is displayed, **When** the user drags an album thumbnail to a different position, **Then** the album moves to the new position and the layout updates immediately
3. **Given** a user is viewing an album, **When** they click to add a custom album, **Then** they can create a new album with a custom name and add photos to it
4. **Given** a user is inside an album, **When** they drag a photo to a different position, **Then** the photo moves to the new position within that album
5. **Given** a user selects a photo, **When** they add a caption or tag, **Then** the caption/tag is saved and displayed with the photo
6. **Given** the user is on a mobile device, **When** they interact with the interface, **Then** all functionality works responsively with touch gestures
7. **Given** a user has thousands of photos, **When** they navigate through albums and photos, **Then** the interface remains responsive and loads efficiently
8. **Given** a user wants to find specific photos, **When** they use the search feature with date range, tags, or captions, **Then** the system returns matching photos quickly and accurately
9. **Given** a user selects multiple photos or albums, **When** they perform drag-and-drop operations, **Then** all selected items move together with clear visual feedback

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user's device has no photos accessible to the application?
- How does the system handle corrupted or unsupported file formats?
- What occurs when the user tries to create an album with a duplicate name?
- How does the system behave when storage space is limited on the device?
- What happens if the user tries to add the same photo to multiple albums?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically organize photos into date-based albums using year/month grouping from photo metadata
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a grid interface of album thumbnails on the main screen
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to reorganize album thumbnails through drag-and-drop functionality
- **FR-004**: System MUST display a tile-based preview of photos within each album
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to create custom albums with user-defined names
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to add photos to custom albums in addition to automatic date grouping
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to rearrange photos within albums through drag-and-drop
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to add captions to individual photos
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to add tags to individual photos
- **FR-010**: System MUST store all data locally on the user's device without uploading to external servers
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle thousands of photos efficiently without performance degradation
- **FR-012**: Interface MUST be responsive and work effectively on both desktop and mobile devices
- **FR-013**: System MUST support touch gestures for mobile device interaction
- **FR-014**: System MUST preserve user customizations (album arrangements, captions, tags) between sessions
- **FR-015**: System MUST support common photo formats including JPEG, PNG, WEBP, and HEIC
- **FR-016**: System MUST parse EXIF metadata to determine photo dates for automatic organization, with fallback to file creation date when EXIF is unavailable
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide search functionality to find photos by date range, tags, or captions
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide visual feedback during drag-and-drop operations
- **FR-019**: System MUST support multi-select functionality for batch operations on photos and albums

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Photo**: Represents an individual image file with metadata including date taken, file path, user-added caption, and user-added tags
- **Album**: Represents a collection of photos, either automatically generated (date-based) or user-created (custom), with a name and display order
- **Tag**: Represents a user-defined label that can be attached to photos for categorization and searching
- **Caption**: Represents user-added descriptive text associated with a specific photo
- **AlbumLayout**: Represents the arrangement and positioning of albums in the main grid interface
- **PhotoLayout**: Represents the arrangement and positioning of photos within a specific album

### Dependencies and Assumptions
- **Dependency**: User device must have local photo files accessible to the web application
- **Dependency**: Browser must support File System Access API or equivalent for local file access
- **Assumption**: Users will grant necessary permissions for the application to access their photo files
- **Assumption**: Photo files contain readable EXIF metadata for date extraction in most cases
- **Assumption**: Users have sufficient local storage for metadata persistence (albums, captions, tags)
- **Constraint**: No server-side storage or processing - all functionality must work entirely client-side
